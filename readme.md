# NHK Easy Print
## UserStyle for Stylus browser extension

Also available on UserStyles.world at [https://userstyles.world/style/9020/nhk-easy-print](https://userstyles.world/style/9020/nhk-easy-print).

Kept here in case I forget where I put it or in case that service goes down.

Formats [NHK Easy](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/easy/) articles for printing on one page with graphics, photos, and extra page features removed. Good for translation practice.

If the article is extra long, turn the zoom down slightly in your print dialog.

## Installing

Either find the linked style above through UserStyles.world in the "Find Styles" function of Stylus while viewing NHK Easy, or create a new style for the site and paste in the contents of userstyle.css.
